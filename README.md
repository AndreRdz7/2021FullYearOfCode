# FullYearOfCode

In this repository I will document progress, results, insights, resources and everything I do related to coding.
The goal is, to do at least 1 hour every single day.
I will document a wide range of activities here, from my work to personal projects, to LeetCode and Codeforces to G4G useful links.
This is similar to the 100DaysOfCodingChallenge I did before, but with a different kind of format.

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2021

**Today's Progress**: DZone familiarization, will be my main source of coding "news", alongside with the daily.dev plugin. Two articles read and 1 book started about testing in mobile devices, will be useful since I will (probably) do a mobile project in the near future. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Starting slow, but it will be getting better by the day, this is just a warmup from the year, I'm coming from a struggling year full of ups and downs and I'm still physically and mentally recovering from it. The best thing of a meh day, is that tomorrow can (and will) be better.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2021

**Today's Progress**: More on LeetCode problems, to warm up more before the big re-start on Monday. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Trends in 2021 look a lot like the ones in 2020, except from GraphQL, it's been a promise several years and it's not a trend or as trendy anymore, the problems that GraphQL solves maybe solved in a better structured regular API and there is no need right now to flood the market looking for GQL developers. Actually, I've never seen a job posting looking specifically for GQL, most jobs either ask for regular SQL (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) or NoSQL (Mongo), no graph databases, blockchain databases... I mean, at least 1 job in the world requires this kinds of knowledge and tech stacks, but its not the case right now, so instead of focusing on polishing GQL I will polish my SQL ans NoSQL skills, specially for my masters degree, since I'll be working with a lot of data.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Will be working on my new job tomorrow (first day of onboarding), so, to refresh my Scrum mindset, I'm re-reading the amazing book I read in 2019, The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, by reading a chapter a day I'll be able to complete it before real-world tasks in my job. Took light after it, inspired by the book, took a look in the DZone on Agile, and found an article about productivity, to focus my attention in one thing and one thing only, this may sound like a no brainer, but it's underrated the non-multitask mindset, specially with social networks and the vast amount of distractions we currently have today. Solved LeetCode Daily Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Happy and nervous about my new job, I know tomorrow is only the first day of my onboarding, I probably won't have anything but the contract signing and some introductory videos of phone calls about my role in the company, but feels really good to be part of them.

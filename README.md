# FullYearOfCode

In this repository I will document progress, results, insights, resources and everything I do related to coding.
The goal is, to do at least 1 hour every single day.
I will document a wide range of activities here, from my work to personal projects, to LeetCode and Codeforces to G4G useful links.
This is similar to the 100DaysOfCodingChallenge I did before, but with a different kind of format.

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2021

**Today's Progress**: DZone familiarization, will be my main source of coding "news", alongside with the daily.dev plugin. Two articles read and 1 book started about testing in mobile devices, will be useful since I will (probably) do a mobile project in the near future. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Starting slow, but it will be getting better by the day, this is just a warmup from the year, I'm coming from a struggling year full of ups and downs and I'm still physically and mentally recovering from it. The best thing of a meh day, is that tomorrow can (and will) be better.

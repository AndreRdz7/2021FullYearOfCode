# FullYearOfCode

In this repository I will document progress, results, insights, resources and everything I do related to coding.
The goal is, to do at least 1 hour every single day.
I will document a wide range of activities here, from my work to personal projects, to LeetCode and Codeforces to G4G useful links.
This is similar to the 100DaysOfCodingChallenge I did before, but with a different kind of format.

---

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2021

**Today's Progress**: DZone familiarization, will be my main source of coding "news", alongside with the daily.dev plugin. Two articles read and 1 book started about testing in mobile devices, will be useful since I will (probably) do a mobile project in the near future. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Starting slow, but it will be getting better by the day, this is just a warmup from the year, I'm coming from a struggling year full of ups and downs and I'm still physically and mentally recovering from it. The best thing of a meh day, is that tomorrow can (and will) be better.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2021

**Today's Progress**: More on LeetCode problems, to warm up more before the big re-start on Monday. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Trends in 2021 look a lot like the ones in 2020, except from GraphQL, it's been a promise several years and it's not a trend or as trendy anymore, the problems that GraphQL solves maybe solved in a better structured regular API and there is no need right now to flood the market looking for GQL developers. Actually, I've never seen a job posting looking specifically for GQL, most jobs either ask for regular SQL (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) or NoSQL (Mongo), no graph databases, blockchain databases... I mean, at least 1 job in the world requires this kinds of knowledge and tech stacks, but its not the case right now, so instead of focusing on polishing GQL I will polish my SQL ans NoSQL skills, specially for my masters degree, since I'll be working with a lot of data.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Will be working on my new job tomorrow (first day of onboarding), so, to refresh my Scrum mindset, I'm re-reading the amazing book I read in 2019, The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, by reading a chapter a day I'll be able to complete it before real-world tasks in my job. Took light after it, inspired by the book, took a look in the DZone on Agile, and found an article about productivity, to focus my attention in one thing and one thing only, this may sound like a no brainer, but it's underrated the non-multitask mindset, specially with social networks and the vast amount of distractions we currently have today. Solved LeetCode Daily Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Happy and nervous about my new job, I know tomorrow is only the first day of my onboarding, I probably won't have anything but the contract signing and some introductory videos of phone calls about my role in the company, but feels really good to be part of them.

## Day 4, Jan 4th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not much, Mostly LeedCode the whole day, found some articles but they weren't nor useful nor interesting, sadly.

**Thoughts**: So my "first day" was only the delivery of my laptop, a huge and powefull MacBook Pro, so I search for videos of configuration and about the product and... it's quite expensive, so I'm really grateful for it, tomorrow I'll meet my team and my role, solo I'm pretty excited about it.

Completed LeetCode Daily Challenge.

**Thoughts**: A lot of meetings today, a lot of info today, really interesting. I love the fact I can talk to the CEO, CTO, etc. whenever I want, it's just amazing the level of communication between all employees and I'm feeling very happy and welcomed.

## Day 9, Jan 9th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed LeetCode Daily Challenge that took me a while.

**Today's Progress**: More information, tomorrow will have a "challenge" to explain what I've learnt, so far so good, I think I can explain everything, at least in the bigger picture. Completed LeetCode Daily Challenge, now an easy one. Read an amazing article about the UI trends for 2021, they look really complex, not gonna lie, I have a lot to learn and progress. Another super interesting article about DevOps, I want to implement on the Ütopyan project, a lot more testing and automation. Navigated through A Cloud Guru to get my traininig for AWS Developer certification, since Verato will be a sponsor, I want to find a good price and do my best to complete my training and examen in a month or less.

**Thoughts**: A nice week start, feeling great about the company and tomorrow will be my computer setup so I can start downloading the code.

## Day 12 Jan 12th 2021

**Today's Progress**: More information, I know, during an onboarding ? crazy. But overall the information feels more "familiar", since I've seen a lot of the products, a lot of the processes, now everything starts to feel more cohesive, even predictable. Solved LeetCode Daily Challenge. I will start my AWS Certification training tomorrow, as well as resuming the Ütopyan project with the Stripe inclusion, and unit testing, really excited about it.

**Thoughts**: Somehow my energy got sky high and could get a proper sleep, ruining my day, but today with an early sleep I'l perform at 200% tomorrow.

## Day 13 Jan 13th 2021

**Today's Progress**: More deep dives on Verato's products, really enjoying the sessions. Completed LeetCode Daily Challenge, funny enough, I solved it in my mind in matter of seconds despite being a Medium problem, and got 100% faster and 100% momory efficient, but once I finished my problem, went to the solution (the only described) and it turned out to be exactly the same, somehow, the bruteforce seemed more difficult to think and code. Started my AWS trining for my certification, probably will be doing the exam at the end of January and I really want to get a great score to show my dedication and knowledge.

**Thoughts**: Feeling better, this whole onboarding felt overwhelming at the beginning but as the days passes it feels easier to understand and I'm feeling closer to the company, I like what they are doing and how they are doing it, such a great pool of smart and talented people.

**Today's Progress**: Successful second week of my new job at Verato and I couldn't be happier, everyone is so smart and friendly, what the company is doing is so incredible. More info on specific products and internal working, that only gave more motivation to enroll in my master's degree in Machine Learning. Also got a lot of insights on how to progress on the company as a developer, how to level up and possibly move to Virginia next year.

**Thoughts**: Feeling great, so motivated to be the very best in order to go to the Virginia HQ.

## Day 16 Jan 16th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Back to the Utopyan project, got a meeting today, we specified the next steps to do, will prioritize them to finish it ASAP since I don't have such a workload that won't allow me to finish it.

**Thoughts**: Nice, back to fullstacking a project, I'll miss my partner Antonio, but it will be fun to finish this alone.

**Resources**:

- [Ütopyan](http://utopyan.com.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

## Day 17 Jan 17th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made my "sprint planning", and I quote it because I'm alone in this project, it's not a s scrum team, but I'll do the plannig according to stories and with an unanimity voting on my side assigning the amount of points per story as I feel, no open debates. The Ütopyan project needs a lot of work, I'll do my very best to finish it the best way possible. Completed LeetCode Daily Challenge.

**Thoughts**: So, I need to organize myself, a lot better, sadly, no more gaming for me, for now.

**Today's Progress**: Worked with my mentor in setting up my environment and get jenkins and kerosene working, along with the UI that I'll be working on, super excited to get started. He provided me with useful links and spent quite some time reading them, a lot of Angular core fundamentals on design patterns and architecture, with best practices and coding styles, a lot of useful information. I got the Trial of Heroes tutorial as "homework", will do it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I want to become an Angular Pro, I'll review every single concept and best practice, along with the coding style guide to deliver the best code possible, I'm determined to get a certification on Angular also.

## Day 19 Jan 19th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued my Verato's onboarding, had some super interesting talks and insights on how the internal logical algorithm works and the overall interal services we interact with. Continued with the setup of the whole dev environment, but mainly it was troubleshooting of previous days and not that many progress since I worked on it with my mentor yesterday. Solved Leetcode Daily Challenge. Will change the goals, the AWS certification it's very helpful, but I won't work a lot with AWS, at least not in my current role and it just happened that I got contacted by a college professor for the oportunity of a big project and offered my 3 free months on a full year subscription to his platform IDF, that offers 32 UI/UX certificates, and as a fullstack developer, I think it will help me a lot, not only for Verato and Ütopyan, but for my future projects that my include my entrepreneurial ones and the big project my professor invited me.

**Thoughts**: Super excited about the offering, also got another one from the Sportsday, a little update that may take me one day to develop and gain just enough for a great Valentine's present for my wife.

Continued with the setup, on the databases of Mongo, Postgres and Solr, along with Tomcat ant Eclipse Setup, tomorrow the setup will be done !

**Thoughts**: I feel les overwhelmed, probably because the amount of information is "less", or maybe because we know the foundations and only going deep dive on certain topics, anyway, it feels easier for now.

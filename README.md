# FullYearOfCode

In this repository I will document progress, results, insights, resources and everything I do related to coding.
The goal is, to do at least 1 hour every single day.
I will document a wide range of activities here, from my work to personal projects, to LeetCode and Codeforces to G4G useful links.
This is similar to the 100DaysOfCodingChallenge I did before, but with a different kind of format.

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2021

**Today's Progress**: DZone familiarization, will be my main source of coding "news", alongside with the daily.dev plugin. Two articles read and 1 book started about testing in mobile devices, will be useful since I will (probably) do a mobile project in the near future. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Starting slow, but it will be getting better by the day, this is just a warmup from the year, I'm coming from a struggling year full of ups and downs and I'm still physically and mentally recovering from it. The best thing of a meh day, is that tomorrow can (and will) be better.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2021

**Today's Progress**: More on LeetCode problems, to warm up more before the big re-start on Monday. LeetCode Daily Challenge completed.

**Thoughts**: Trends in 2021 look a lot like the ones in 2020, except from GraphQL, it's been a promise several years and it's not a trend or as trendy anymore, the problems that GraphQL solves maybe solved in a better structured regular API and there is no need right now to flood the market looking for GQL developers. Actually, I've never seen a job posting looking specifically for GQL, most jobs either ask for regular SQL (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) or NoSQL (Mongo), no graph databases, blockchain databases... I mean, at least 1 job in the world requires this kinds of knowledge and tech stacks, but its not the case right now, so instead of focusing on polishing GQL I will polish my SQL ans NoSQL skills, specially for my masters degree, since I'll be working with a lot of data.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Will be working on my new job tomorrow (first day of onboarding), so, to refresh my Scrum mindset, I'm re-reading the amazing book I read in 2019, The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, by reading a chapter a day I'll be able to complete it before real-world tasks in my job. Took light after it, inspired by the book, took a look in the DZone on Agile, and found an article about productivity, to focus my attention in one thing and one thing only, this may sound like a no brainer, but it's underrated the non-multitask mindset, specially with social networks and the vast amount of distractions we currently have today. Solved LeetCode Daily Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Happy and nervous about my new job, I know tomorrow is only the first day of my onboarding, I probably won't have anything but the contract signing and some introductory videos of phone calls about my role in the company, but feels really good to be part of them.

## Day 4, Jan 4th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not much, Mostly LeedCode the whole day, found some articles but they weren't nor useful nor interesting, sadly.

**Thoughts**: So my "first day" was only the delivery of my laptop, a huge and powefull MacBook Pro, so I search for videos of configuration and about the product and... it's quite expensive, so I'm really grateful for it, tomorrow I'll meet my team and my role, solo I'm pretty excited about it.

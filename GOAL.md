# Goals for 2021

Short, Medium and Long term goals will be recorded here, some may be removed if I don't enjoy the journey to the goal or if I change my mind about it, but in general, this will record my goals, what am I achieving and what have I achieved.

Besides from retake my habit of daily coding/learning I want to get certified to boost my CV and confidence, to be a better programmer with the best current practices, someone who writes clean and understandable code, maintainable code, documented code, GREAT code in general.

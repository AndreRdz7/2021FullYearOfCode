# Goals for 2021

Short, Medium and Long term goals will be recorded here, some may be removed if I don't enjoy the journey to the goal or if I change my mind about it, but in general, this will record my goals, what am I achieving and what have I achieved.

Besides from retake my habit of daily coding/learning I want to get certified to boost my CV and confidence, to be a better programmer with the best current practices, someone who writes clean and understandable code, maintainable code, documented code, GREAT code in general. Also this will only be related to coding, personal (health, finances, etc.) goals will be excluded from this, but they will indirectly influence in this part of my life.
